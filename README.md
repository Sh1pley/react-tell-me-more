This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Still an even bigger work in progress!

## Meaning of existance

  - This is an attempt and learning / teaching ReactJS
  - After running through a great [Tutorial by Tyler McGinnis](https://online.reacttraining.com/courses/). I am trying to piece it all together

## What works
  - Not much, basic Hello World at this point

## WIP
  - add login / create form to access separate API on Heroku
  - react-bootstrap for base styling
  - add map with app accessing IP markers
  - eventually websockets and topics for discussion based on ip location
