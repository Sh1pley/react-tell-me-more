This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Still an even bigger work in progress!

## Meaning of existance

  - This is an attempt and learning / teaching ReactJS
  - After running through a great [Tutorial by Tyler McGinnis](https://online.reacttraining.com/courses/). I am trying to piece it all together

## Updates on the fun
  - {this.progress}
    => react-router is fun
  - {this.painInTheAss}
    => just about everything at this point!
  - On the bright side, toying around with state, this, and router has brought on a lot of ideas
  - at this point, [visit me](https://interesting-tell-me-more.herokuapp.com/#/) and marvel and the lack of progress! haha

## What works
  - Not much, basic Hello World at this point
  - Basic routing, toying with the idea of passing {this.props} into buttons and headers to make the experience fun
  - Working with inputs to pass params/queries to auth into my external API

## WIP
  - add login / create form to access separate API on Heroku
  - react-bootstrap for base styling - this is happening!
  - add map with app accessing IP markers
  - eventually websockets and topics for discussion based on ip location
